        <div class="au_text_container" data-location="patan">
          <p>
            Kalpeshbhai, the founder of Yugvandana, resigned from his job as a
            forest guard after a year and moved to Mukherjeenagar, Delhi, for
            UPSC preparation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he returned to
            Gujarat in 2020 and found that Gandhinagar lacked libraries with
            essential facilities. Faced with this challenge, Kalpeshbhai and his
            wife Alka shifted to Palanpur, where they joined a simple library.
            After a few months, they realized the significant impact a
            well-equipped library could have on a student's reading capacity.
            Inspired, they decided to create an ideal library.
          </p>
          <p>
            On January 15, 2022, Kalpeshbhai established the first branch of
            Yugvandana Library in Palanpur, making it the most modern library in
            North Gujarat at the time. After gaining experience in library
            management, he expanded to Gandhinagar, opening a unique and
            attractive library in Sector-11 on August 21, 2022. The innovative
            facilities and services attracted significant attention on social
            media, and students began promoting the library, earning Yugvandana
            a prominent reputation in the library field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the success in Gandhinagar, Yugvandana opened another
            branch in Sector-6 and then the largest branch in Patan city. The
            Patan branch introduced the concept of PowerNap beds, which became
            popular among students. Today, Yugvandana Library Patan is the
            largest branch, and thousands of students are joining Yugvandana to
            achieve their academic goals through the well-equipped libraries.
